0. Prerequisites:
- install ROS foxy .
https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Linux-Install-Debians.html
  1. start by source command
    source /opt/ros/foxy/local_setup.bash
  2. set ros2 as default on linux
    echo "source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
  3. check default system environment
    gedit ~/.bashrc
  4. environment vairable
    printenv | grep -i ROS
- extension packages
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
    sudo apt install libyaml-cpp-dev 
    sudo apt install ~nros-foxy-rqt*
    sudo apt install ros-foxy-diagnostic-updater
    sudo apt-get install python-caktin-tools
    sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-ros2bag \
                        ros-foxy-rosbag2-converter-default-plugins \

1. ROS2 hello world
- Introducing turtlesim and rqt
https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Turtlesim/Introducing-Turtlesim.html

2. ROS2 concept and feature
(key words: Publisher/Subscriber/Topic//Nodes/Services/Quality of Service/ROS Client Library --> rclcpp)
- ROS2 concept
  - https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Concepts.html#internal-ros-interfaces

- Understanding ROS 2 nodes
https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Understanding-ROS2-Nodes.html

3. package
(key words: CMakeLists.txt, package.xml)
Creating your first ROS 2 package
https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Creating-Your-First-ROS2-Package.html

4. build(build, install, log)
- Using colcon to build packages
https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Colcon-Tutorial.html
colcon list
colcon graph
rm -rf install log build

5. source
When colcon has completed building successfully, the output will be in the install directory. Before you can use any of the installed executables or libraries, you will need to add them to your path and library paths. colcon will have generated bash/bat files in the install directory to help setup the environment. These files will add all of the required elements to your path and library paths as well as provide any bash or shell commands exported by packages.
. install/setup.bash

6. run/launch
Launch files allow you to start up and configure a number of executables containing ROS 2 nodes simultaneously.
Creating a launch file
https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Launch-Files/Creating-Launch-Files.html
https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/How-To-Guides/Launch-file-different-formats.html

call launch by bash script:
chmod 777 xxx.sh
sudo ./xxx.sh

7. record and replay
Recording and playing back data
https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Ros2bag/Recording-And-Playing-Back-Data.html

8. data visualization with RViz
   http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/UserGuide
   
9. rqt
Using rqt Tools for Analysis:https://industrial-training-master.readthedocs.io/en/melodic/_source/session6/Using-rqt-tools-for-analysis.html
- rqt_graph -->arch
  use rqt_graph to visualize the changing nodes and topics, as well as the connections between them.

- rqt_console -->log in GUI

10. node develop use c++
    - Writing a simple publisher and subscriber
    https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Writing-A-Simple-Cpp-Publisher-And-Subscriber.html
    For the publisher node, spinning meant starting the timer, but for the subscriber it simply means preparing to receive messages whenever they come
      - configure
      - advertiseOutputs() --> create_publisher<messages>(topic,...)
      - subscribeToInputs() --> create_subscription<messages>(topic,rclQoS,getInputCallback)
      - runTask() --> create_wall_timer(cycle_time,publishCallback)
        --> fuse()
        --> publish()
